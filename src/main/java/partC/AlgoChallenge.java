     /* Problem 24
    Every string needs to begin with "not", in order to do that you need to add "not" to the beginning of a provided string.
    But if the string already begins with "not" we will leave it alone, no need to have a "not not".
    Return a new string where "not" has been added to the front.
    Tip: Use .equals() to compare 2 strings
    Example:
    beginWithNot("candy") --> "not candy"
    beginWithNot("x") --> "not x"
    beginWithNot("not bad") --> "not bad"

    public static String beginWithNot(String not) {

        return null;
    }


     /* Problem 25
       The most popular number today is 3. We need the first 3 characters of a string, and we need to make
       3 copies of those 3 characters. The front of a string is considered those 3 characters. The front can
       be less than 3, just need to provide whatever is there.
       Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front of the string.
       Example:
       popular3("Java") --> "JavJavJav"
       popular3("Chocolate") --> "ChoChoCho"
       popular3("abc") --> "abcabcabc"
